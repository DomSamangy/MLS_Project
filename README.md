# MLS_Project
A project I completed with the goal of identifying a position of need for an MLS club as they approach the trade deadline. Assuming the GM role, I was to identify 3 targets that met the $400,000 max salary restraint. 

With a short turnaround for the report, I needed to move swiftly. Due to this constraint, I identified these steps as my approach to completing the project in a timely manner. 

1. Identify which team and area of play (offense, midfield, defense) was in the most urgent need of a trade/acquisition. 
2. Narrow the list of qualifying players to a list that could be analyzed on a deeper level.
3. Based on on-pitch performance and financial value, identify the final 3 targets.
4. Finally, choose the player to be traded for and also provide an analysis on comparable trade pieces.

In order to complete the report, I pulled data from American Soccer Analysis for each area of play. Using RStudio, I cleaned and merged the raw data into useful data frames for analysis. This included scatterplots for comparisons of teams and players and radar charts to compare the final 3 targets. All of this work can be found above in the Final Report pdf. If needed, the code attached can be ran in full using the datasets in the data folder.
